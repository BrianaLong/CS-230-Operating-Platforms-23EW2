Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms for their game, Draw It or Lose It. The game is inspired by the game television game show Win, Lose, Draw. Which involves teams guessing phrases and titles based on drawings. The game must be multiplayer with teams. Each game and team must have a unique name. The system check will make sure this requirement is met to prevent confusion. All identifiers will be active in one game instance in memory.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
WHat I had done particulary well in developing this documentation is researching the evaulation of each platform to determine which would suit the program best.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found the UML diagram extremely helpful for developing the code for the project. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The one part of the document I would revise would be the system architecture overview. I felt this part of the document was lacking in information.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took the user's needs and implimented them into the design by ensuring the code function properly. When designing to meet a client's needs it is important to meet all specifications they require first.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When designing the software research was needed to interpret the already present pieces. I found it was important to read through the present code and understand it before fixing the required parts.
